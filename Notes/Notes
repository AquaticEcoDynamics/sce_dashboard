1) The scevo build script accepts a few options :

    --all        : rebuild the package, docker images and saved images
    --just-save  : just save the docker images
    --package    : build the package - by default it only builds the package if it's not there
    --no-base    : dont build scevo_base


2) if you are using this in shinyproxy ( see https://shinyproxy.io/documentation/getting-started/ )
   an example config is included as application.yml

3) Changing shinyproxy config ( sudo vi /etc/shinyproxy/application.yml ) will
   require a restart of shinyproxy server :

      sudo service shinyproxy restart

   and then there is a significant delay before it becomes usable.  Check
   using :

      sudo service shinyproxy status
